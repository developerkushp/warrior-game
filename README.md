# Assignment #5

### Please make sure to move the `.gitgnore` file to the root of your project folder before pushing. So if I have a new Unity project named `As5` on my local, I will:  

1. Clone this repo
2. Move the project `As5` folder inside the local repo folder (that was cloned in Step 1).
3. Move the `.gitignore` file (that exists in the cloned repo folder) into the `As5` folder. 
4. Push

> **Note:** Not all your project folders will be pushed to github. This is due to the `.gitignore` file in the root of this repo. This makes our projects much smaller and easier to maintain, since most of the template-y files can be auto-generated by Unity later. So folders like `Logs`, `Builds`, `Obj`, `Temp` and `Library` etc will not be pushed (which is intentional). You do not have to make any changes, just commit+push normally and git will take care of this. Just know that some of your folders(and/or files) might be missing on github even if they exist on your computer, and that is intended and is completely fine.
